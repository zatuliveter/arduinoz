/* Chances are you donâ€™t have an STM32F103C8T6 chip, but a Chinese clone, 
namely CS32F103C8T6 from China Key System & Integrated. That one is reported to 
use the 0x2ba01477 (as the IDcode or rather as the SW-DP tap id).

As a workaround, you can edit the file 
  ~/.platformio/packages/tool-openocd/scripts/target/stm32f1x.cfg 
and change the line:

set _CPUTAPID 0x1ba01477
to:
set _CPUTAPID 0x2ba01477
